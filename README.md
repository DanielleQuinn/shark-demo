# shark-demo
A coding demonstration and activity for Skype a Scientist.
1. Introduction to sharks and importance of sharks to ocean health (not included)

2. How can we use coding to study and protect sharks? (shark-ppt.pptx)
  - Introduce four study species
  - Introduce concept of "data" and how it is collected
  - Students count how many of each species was caught, those values added to a graph
  - Discuss how visualizing data makes it easier to understand
  - What if you have more data? You can use code to tell a computer to count for you!
 
 3. Coding demo (demo_code.R)
  - Source setup_code.R
  - Walk through demonstration
  - Discuss points in comments; what have we learned about each species? How can that information help us protect sharks (by making rules about where people are allowed to fish)?
  
Disclaimers:
- These data are artificially generated.
- This is still a work in progress, with very clunky code that will (eventually) be cleaned!
- The data might not reflect the actual species...
- I have "spiny dogfish" in the slides and "black dogfish" in the data... *sigh*
